make sure you have python installed :)

HOW TO USE:
1. Put the raw SM chart data in newfile.txt by opening the SM with a text editor and copying the text under the desired chart heading (and above the next heading if the SM has more than one chart). Do not include the headings in the txt file.

EXAMPLE HEADING:

//--------------- dance-double - Toony3243 ----------------

#NOTES:

dance-double:

Toony3243:

Challenge:

1:

0,0,0,0,0:

2. Put the BPMs and timestamps in bpms.txt by copying the metadata marked #BPMS and removing the commas (do not save the SM if you remove the commas directly in the file!).

EXAMPLE:

#BPMS:0.000=220.000;

(only copy the bpms (left) and timestamps(right))

3. Run the output, put the song name when prompted, and have fun in Psych Engine :)
